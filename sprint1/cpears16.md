# Sprint 1

Collins Pearson (collinspearson on github)

### What you planned to do
I planned to create a Library for the music. This would list the songs and allow the user to sort and filter them.

### What you accomplished
I was able to write the backend functionality for displaying, sorting, and filtering the songs.

### What you did not accomplish
I was not able to display the actual buttons for each song. I needed the tab functionality complete to use it as a base to add the buttons, though we didn't have access to that yet.
