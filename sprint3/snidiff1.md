# Sprint 3

Skye Nidiffer - GH ID: nidif - Downloaded Music Player

### What you planned to do
- Settings Tab UI (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/21)
- Settings Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/22)
- Explore Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/30)

### What you did not do
- Explore tab is not yet fully functional, as I am still learning and working out how to do the webscraping and how to call it from the app when the explore page is loaded. I will work on this more in Sprint 4. Using Python for the web scraping right now.
- Settings tab UI and functions are just basic right now, but they are saved to a file for the app to read/write with react-native-fs. Additional settings can be added as needed.

### What problems you encountered
- Learning how to do web scraping and calling Python scripts from inside the app is taking some time, but there are resources available to learn from.
