# Sprint 3

Skye Nidiffer - GH ID: nidif - Downloaded Music Player

### What you planned to do
- Settings Tab UI (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/21)
- Settings Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/22)
- Explore Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/30)

### What you did not do
- Explore tab is not yet fully functional, as I am still learning and working out how to do the web scraping and how to call it from the app when the explore page is loaded. I will work on this more in Sprint 4.
- Settings tab UI is just basic right now, but additional settings can be added as needed. Still working on getting something working with reading/writing to files.

### What problems you encountered
- Learning how to do web scraping and calling it from inside the app is taking some time, but there are resources available to learn from. Reading/writing files with expo-file-system is difficult because of lack of documentation. May look into alternatives.

### Issues you worked on
- Settings Tab UI (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/21)
- Settings Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/22)
- Explore Tab Functionality (issue https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/DownloadedMusicPlayer/issues/30)

### Files you worked on
- DownloadedMusicPlayer/SkeletonCode/App.js - Added settings UI. Explore tab functionality and UI is still in progress.

### What you accomplished
- Settings UI is in place, can be added upon as needed, variables and switches can be accessed within the app.
- Solid research and planning towards getting explore page done by sprint 4.
